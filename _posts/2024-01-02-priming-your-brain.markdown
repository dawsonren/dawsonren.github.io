It's the first day of a new quarter (and new year!), and classes are starting again. In order to prepare myself after a long break, I usually try to "prime my brain" by getting an overall idea of what the class is about and what applicable knowledge I bring into the class. Since I've done this for the past 4 years, I'm codifying what this process looks like for future me, as I'm sure it'll be helpful in graduate school.

The main purpose of this process is to make connections between concepts I already know and concepts I'll encounter in the future. That way, I'm not caught off-guard when things get complicated in the later part of the quarter.

The main deliverable is a "roadmap" for what I'll be learning. My Real Analysis class this past fall did a great job with this on the first day of class - the professor highlighted which key theorems we'd be proving and how [they're all related](https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~scanez/courses/320/notes/lecture-notes-320-1.pdf). Essentially, what topics should you already know, what will you learn, and what intuitions do I need to build along the way? Keep in mind that this is mainly for STEM fields where classes and concepts tend to follow a strict progression, so I'm not sure how useful this advice is otherwise.

In case my future self is feeling lazy, a quick reminder of the benefits of this approach:
1. Helps you catch holes in your knowledge/things you should already know
2. As you're creating the roadmap, you may come across techniques/proof that will be on the homework later.
3. Since you know what's coming up and how it fits into the bigger picture, you can "think ahead" in classes rather than scrambling to make everything fit together.

And a warning: the [Forest of All Knowledge](https://www.lunarmobiscuit.com/the-forest-of-all-knowledge/) is an never-ending, ever-expanding fractal. Try to stick to a breadth-first search approach rather than a depth-first search. Your goal is to create a skeleton that you can fill in as you take the class, not a really filled-in foot (sorry if that's a gross analogy). Basically, if you're anything like me, limit the number of tangents you go on!

The Process:
1. Gather resources. Some good places to look are your Canvas/class webpage and the textbook. If they're lacking, you can usually find syllabi for similar classes at other universities with a quick online search.
2. Create the document. Make a list of the main topics you'll be covering, in order. Don't worry if they don't make a whole lot of sense!
3. Review the basics. Every textbook usually contains a first chapter/appendix that highlights prerequisites. Make sure you feel comfortable with those first. This can look like a brief skim at your previous lecture notes, or doing a few relevant practice problems.
4. Fill in the gaps. Define confusing terms in your class from the list of topics. Don't feel like you have to use the most technical definition, just try to intuitively understand how it relates to the larger topic. You may need to go a few layers deep on definiions to get to something you understand.
5. Make connections. If you're taking a class that's a refinement/continuation of a previous one (Approximate Algorithms after Algorithms, Stochastic Processes II after Stochastic Processes I), spot where concepts you learned previously come into play.

Once you've completed this process, the roadmap doesn't have to be something you look back on. The law of diminishing returns applies here too, you'll probably learn extraneous and unnecessary information if you research for too long (an hour for each class usually works for me, longer if I need to review concepts from previous classes). I've learned that this process ultimately prepares you to become a lifelong learner, as you discover self-learning resources and digest large concepts without having all the details.

Happy learning, and good luck on your classes!
