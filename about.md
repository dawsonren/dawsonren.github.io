Hello there! I'm Dawson Ren, currently a student studying Industrial Engineering and Computer Science at Northwestern University.

I'm a firm believer that the things we take for granted are often more than they seem. I also believe that in the age of information, the answers are closer than ever before. This blog is an outlet for my curiosity, a place where I can put down all those "what if...?" conversations.

Right now, I'm curious about how we can leverage compututational thinking, math, and statistics to help make decisions in the face of uncertainty. If you don't have any background in these areas, don't worry - I promise that you'll still learn something worthwhile, and see the world a little differently because of it.
