Hello there! I'm Dawson Ren, currently a student studying Industrial Engineering at Northwestern University. I'm currently applying to Operations Research PhD programs as well.

I'm a firm believer that the things we take for granted are often much more than they seem. I also believe that in the age of information, the answers are closer than ever before. This blog is an outlet for my curiosity, a place where I can put down all those "what if...?" conversations.

Right now, I'm curious about how we can leverage OR and ML techniques for decision-making under uncertainty. If you don't have any background in these areas, don't worry - I promise that you'll still learn something worthwhile, and see the world a little differently because of it.
